      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a somewhat nomadic designer and product strategist.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm originally from the Dallas area, but I've been travelling a bit since then.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I travel a lot and like to take pictures (you can see my photography <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://photography.gnefkow.com">here</a>). I also draw a lot and I like to play guitar and read books.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I'd really like to be a futurist when I grow up. I love speculative strategy.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Its hard to say. Soon I'll live in New York, but at the time of this assignment, I'm in Siem Riep, Cambodia. I've been living in Myanmar for the last year,and I'm headig to Taiwan next week.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>For fun. As a designer and product strategist, I spend a lot of time helping people envision their future business potential. Most of these strategies involve building a lot of sofware, so it makes sense to learn more of the mechanics of everything. Since my last contract ended, and a few of my friends have gone through the program and learned a lot, I figured I should as well. The problem with being a designer is that you're really only able to draw pictures. It is better to build stuff.</p>
